 Concurrent homework 1
 ./prog1 n r a b s x y

 A program that takes seven positive integers n, r, a, b, s, x and y from its command line arguments, 
 creates four child processes, waits for them to complete, and exits. 

 The first process computes the n-th Fibonacci number fn using recursion.
 The second process finds the solution of Buffon's needle problem by throwing a needle r times
 The third process computes the area of an ellipse
 The fourth process simulates a simple pinball game.

 ---------------------------------Question 1---------------------------------
 	There are 4 child processes created
 	The parent forks a child, then breaks the loop, then the child that was created 
 	forks another child, and breaks the loop, and so on
 	
 	Parent -> Proc1 -> Proc2 -> Proc3 -> Proc4
		|	|	 |	  |
		V	V	 V	  V
		Parent  Proc1	 Proc2	  Proc3
		Breaks	Breaks   Breaks	  Breaks
		Within  W/in If	 W/in If  W/in If
		If Loop	
 ----------------------------------Question 2---------------------------------
 	There are 4 child processes created
	This is very similar to the previous program except instead
		of the parent process breaking out of the loop,
		the child process breaks and the parent creates
		multiple other child processes

	Parent -> Proc1 -> break and print
		->Proc2 -> break and print
		->Proc3 -> break and print
		->Proc4 -> break and print

 ---------------------------------Question 3---------------------------------
	The program will only break if the fork() call didn't work. This means that
		most of the processes created will not break out of the loop. 
		7 processes are created and each of them continue in the loop, creating 
		more child processes until n is reached.

	Parent -> Proc1
	Parent -> Proc2
	Parent -> Proc3
	Proc1 -> Proc4
	Proc1 -> Proc5
	Proc4 -> Proc6
	Proc5 -> Proc7
 ---------------------------------Question 4---------------------------------
	The type of distribution is a bell curve distribution. I believe that the distribution
		is as such because it order for it to reach "the ends" it has to "roll" greater
		than .5 multiple times in a row or "roll" less than .5 multiple times in a row
		which is less likely.
