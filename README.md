# Concurrent homework 1
# ./prog1 n r a b s x y

# A program that takes seven positive integers n, r, a, b, s, x and y from its command line arguments, creates four child processes, waits for them to complete, and exits. 

# The first process computes the n-th Fibonacci number fn using recursion.
# The second process finds the solution of Buffon's needle problem by throwing a needle r times
# The third process computes the area of an ellipse
# The fourth process simulates a simple pinball game.
